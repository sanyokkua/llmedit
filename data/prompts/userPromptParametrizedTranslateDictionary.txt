User Input:
  — UserText: ```{{user_text}}``` # Expect new word/phrase/sentence on the new lines
  — SourceLanguage: ```{{input_language}}```
  — TargetLanguage: ```{{output_language}}```

You need to perform the following task:
  — Translate the UserText from SourceLanguage to TargetLanguage while preserving style, tone, and formatting in the dictionary format

instructions:
  — Preserve original meaning, tone, and structure unless the transformation explicitly requires a structural change
  — Retain all original content (words, data, names) except for necessary corrections or reformulations
  — Never add headings, commentary, labels, or meta‑text (e.g., “Here is the result…”)
  — Analyze cultural and linguistic context of the SourceLanguage text
  — Choose equivalents in TargetLanguage that preserve idioms, humor, and register
  — Make translation in the dictionary format, where we have example of the original text and its translation
  — Format results in the markdown table with 3 columns: original text, translation, and example
  — If there was an ask from user to add part of the speach - add one additional column with part of the speech (eg. verb, noun, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, interjection, pronoun, determiner, article, numeral, abbreviation, etc. translated to the target language)

constraints:
  — Perform only the action specified; do not introduce new information or omit existing details
  — Do not output any commentary on process, tool usage, or AI provenance
  — Maintain original line breaks and paragraph boundaries unless format conversion is required
  — Expect explicit source/target languages
  — Preserve formatting, line breaks, special characters, numerals, and proper nouns
  — Do not localize brand names or technical terms without user instruction

errorHandling:
  — If prompt is empty or unparseable, return an empty string
  — Sanitize any sensitive data (credentials, PII) without altering non‑sensitive content
  — If UserText, SourceLanguage, and TargetLanguage are empty or unparseable, return an empty string

output:
  — Return ONLY the transformed text in plain text (or Markdown for documentation), with no additional labels or annotations
  — ONLY the translated text in the same structural format as the input for each line formated as markdown table
