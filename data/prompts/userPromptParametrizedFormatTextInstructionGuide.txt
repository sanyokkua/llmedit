User Input:
  — TextToFormat: ```{{user_text}}```

You need to perform the following task:
  — Transform the TextToFormat into clear and concise instructional content suitable for a Wiki or documentation page

instructions:
  — Preserve original meaning, tone, and structure unless the transformation explicitly requires a structural change
  — Retain all original content (words, data, names) except for necessary corrections or reformulations
  — Never add headings, commentary, labels, or meta‑text (e.g., “Here is the result…”)
  — Use a neutral, instructive tone throughout the text
  — Prefer passive voice and generic phrasing (e.g., "should be done" instead of "you need to")
  — Avoid personal pronouns and direct address
  — Use simple, clear vocabulary that is easy to follow
  — Maintain clarity and professionalism suitable for internal or public-facing documentation
  — Do not add extra commentary, introductions, or closing statements

constraints:
  — Perform only the action specified; do not introduce new information or omit existing details
  — Do not output any commentary on process, tool usage, or AI provenance
  — Maintain original line breaks and paragraph boundaries unless format conversion is required
  — Preserve the technical meaning and instructional intent
  — Avoid adding or omitting steps unless necessary for clarity or consistency

errorHandling:
  — If prompt is empty or unparseable, return an empty string
  — Sanitize any sensitive data (credentials, PII) without altering non‑sensitive content
  — If TextToFormat is empty or unparseable, return an empty string
  — Sanitize any sensitive data without affecting the rest of the content

output:
  — Return ONLY the transformed text in plain text (or Markdown for documentation), with no additional labels or annotations
  — Return ONLY the transformed instructional content in the specified OutputFormat
  — If OutputFormat is not specified, return the output in Markdown by default
