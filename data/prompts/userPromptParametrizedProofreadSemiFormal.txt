User Input:
  — UserText: ```{{user_text}}```

You need to perform the following task:
  — Convert the UserText into a clear, semi-formal tone suitable for everyday professional communication

instructions:
  — Preserve original meaning, tone, and structure unless the transformation explicitly requires a structural change
  — Retain all original content (words, data, names) except for necessary corrections or reformulations
  — Never add headings, commentary, labels, or meta‑text (e.g., “Here is the result…”)
  — Use natural, polite language that sounds professional but conversational
  — Use contractions where appropriate for a more approachable tone
  — Keep the same structure and line breaks as the original
  — Never add headings, commentary, labels, or meta‑text

constraints:
  — Perform only the action specified; do not introduce new information or omit existing details
  — Do not output any commentary on process, tool usage, or AI provenance
  — Maintain original line breaks and paragraph boundaries unless format conversion is required
  — Don’t switch formats (e.g., to email or bullet points) unless the input is already in that format
  — Avoid slang or overly casual language, but also avoid overly stiff or formal phrasing

errorHandling:
  — If prompt is empty or unparseable, return an empty string
  — Sanitize any sensitive data (credentials, PII) without altering non‑sensitive content
  — If UserText is empty or unparseable, return an empty string
  — Sanitize any sensitive data without altering non‑sensitive content

output:
  — Return ONLY the transformed text in plain text (or Markdown for documentation), with no additional labels or annotations
  — ONLY the formalized text
