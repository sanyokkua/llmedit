User Input:
  — UserText: ```{{user_text}}```

You need to perform the following task:
  — Convert the UserText to a formal, professional tone suitable for reports or business communications

instructions:
  — Preserve original meaning, tone, and structure unless the transformation explicitly requires a structural change
  — Retain all original content (words, data, names) except for necessary corrections or reformulations
  — Never add headings, commentary, labels, or meta‑text (e.g., “Here is the result…”)
  — Eliminate contractions; use precise, professional vocabulary
  — Maintain the same overall structure and line breaks
  — Never add headings, commentary, labels, or meta‑text

constraints:
  — Perform only the action specified; do not introduce new information or omit existing details
  — Do not output any commentary on process, tool usage, or AI provenance
  — Maintain original line breaks and paragraph boundaries unless format conversion is required
  — Do not convert to email or another format unless input already is in this format
  — Avoid colloquialisms and informal expressions

errorHandling:
  — If prompt is empty or unparseable, return an empty string
  — Sanitize any sensitive data (credentials, PII) without altering non‑sensitive content
  — If UserText is empty or unparseable, return an empty string
  — Sanitize any sensitive data without altering non‑sensitive content

output:
  — Return ONLY the transformed text in plain text (or Markdown for documentation), with no additional labels or annotations
